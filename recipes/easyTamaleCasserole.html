    <h1>Easy Tamale Casserole</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2> 
        <p>This tamale casserole gives me memories of home. My mom liked to make the Hamburger Helper version of this recipe. When I moved to another state, I could not find it, so I came up with this. My hubby likes for me to spice this up sometimes, so I will add a 14-ounce can of tomatoes and green chiles or use a Mexican-style cornbread mix.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 (15 ounce) cans pinto beans, rinsed and drained</li>
        <li>2 (15 ounce) cans crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) can cream-style corn</li>
        <li>1 (6 ounce) box cornbread mix</li>
        <li>1 large egg, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Heat a cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Season beef with salt and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Stir onion into ground beef; cook and stir over medium heat for 1 minute, then immediately remove the skillet from heat. Stir in pinto beans and crushed tomatoes.</li>
        <li>Beat together cream-style corn, cornbread mix, and egg in a large bowl until smooth; spread over ground beef mixture in the skillet. Sprinkle with Cheddar cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and cornbread is set in the middle, about 25 minutes.</li>
